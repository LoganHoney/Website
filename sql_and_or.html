            <h2>What are logical operators?</h2>
            <p>Logical operators are used to apply multiple criteria that data must meet in order to be retrieved by our query. Criteria for data is placed in the <span class = "highliht">WHERE</span> clause. Logical operators differ from comparison operators in that logical operators are testing wether the criteria is met and not actully defining the criteria. </p>
            <p>Some common logical operators include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AND</li>
                <li>OR</li>
                <li>NOT</li> 
                <li>LIKE</li> 
                <li>IN</li> 
                <li>BETWEEN</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Some less common logical operators include: 
            <ul>
                <li>SOME</li>
                <li>ANY</li>
                <li>ALL</li> 
                <li>EXISTS</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>These logical operators are used in conjunction with <span class = "highlight">subqueries</span> and will be covered in depth later. For now, just now that these less common operators are used in incredibly specific scenarios.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="two">
            <h2>AND & OR</h2>
            <p>The two operators I want to share today are AND & OR as they are the two most common logical operators in my experience.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">AND</span> is used to return data <strong>only when both</strong> conditions between the AND are met.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">OR</span> is used to retuen data <strong>when at least one</strong> of the conditions are met </p>
            <p>There is no limit on how many logical operators that can be used in a WHERE clause. However, it is important to note that the distinctions between how these two operators work are huge. As more <span class ="highlight">AND</span> operators are added, the resulting dataset will be smaller as more constrains are being placed on the data. In contrast, as more <span class="highlight">OR</span> operators are added, the resulting dataset will grow because the data needs only meet <strong>one</strong> of the criteria and not <strong>all</strong>.</p>

            <h2>SQL Syntax: Using AND & OR</h2>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p><strong>Customers Table</strong></p>
            <pre>
Customer_ID | First_Name | Last_Name
----------- | -----------|----------
101         | Alice      | Johnson

            <h3>To Note</h3>
            <div class = "grid2">

                    <p>AND operators cannot be applied to the same columns. For Example:</p>
                    <h4>Query</h4>
                    <code><pre>
SELECT Customer_ID
FROM Customers
WHERE First_Name = 'Bob'
        AND First_Name = 'Alice'
                                </pre></code>
                                           
                
                
                <h4>Result</h4>
                <code><pre>
Customer_ID
-----------
                     
                    
                </pre></code>
                <p>The reason that this will not work is because there is no instance where a single row in the <code>First_Name</code> column can be both Alice and Bob simultaneously.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div class = "grid2">
            <div class = "definition2">
                
                <p>The OR operator can be used since only one of the conditions needs to be true to return a row. For Example:</p>
                <h4>Query</h4>
                <code><pre>
SELECT Customer_ID
FROM Customers
WHERE First_Name = 'Bob'
        OR First_Name = 'Alice'
                </pre></code>
                                    
                
            
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <code><pre>
Customer_ID
-----------
101
102
106
                
            </pre></code>
            <p>This returns every <code>Customer_ID</code> for rows in the <code>First_Name</code> column that equal either Bob or Alice.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
            <p>The logical operators <span class="highlight">AND</span> & <span class="highlight">OR</span> are the foundations of building complex conditions. After all, a database is only as helpful as our ability to find what we seek. AND & OR are fantastic tools to add to you toolbox. </p>
            <p>In the next article of this series, we will explore <span class = "highlight">Comparison Operators</span>. Comparison operators go hand in hand with logical operators. </p>
