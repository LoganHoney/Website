            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <h4> "If we are not moving forward, we are moving backwards." </h4>
            <p> This quote is one that has stuck with me throughout my career. It isn't enough to just maintain status quo, we must continuously be working to improve ourselves. Improving our soft and hard skills also benefits those around us. I decided to take my career seriously in Fall 2023. I have always had an interest in Tech and decided to pursue a career in that field. I realized I needed to learn skills to bring to the table. </p>

            <h2> My Education </h2>
            <h4> St. Petersburg College (2017-2019)</h4>
            <p> I earned a baseline AA from SPC. I didn't know what career path to take so a generic degree seemed to be the best option at the time!</p>
            <h4> Pasco Hernando State College (2023 - Present)</h4>
            <p> After a 4 year break from school and gaining some work experience. I decided to start pursuing my career in tech by enrolling in PHSC's Computer Programming and Analysis AS degree. In this program I've learned the basics of OOP, SQL, and Web Development </p>
            <h4> YouTube </h4>
            <p> Yep, you read that right, YouTube! It amazes me how many resources are at your fingertips. School projects are fun and all but there is nothing like experimenting and learning something new from scratch through personal projects! <br>
            Here are a few YouTube channels that I believe provide outstanding content for learning new skills:</p>
