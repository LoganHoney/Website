			<h2> My Education </h2>
		            <h4> St. Petersburg College (2017-2019)</h4>
		           	 <p> I earned a baseline AA from SPC. I didn't know what career path to take so a generic degree seemed to be the best option at the time!</p>
		            <h4> Pasco Hernando State College (2023 - Present)</h4>
		            	<p> After a 4 year break from school and gaining some work experience. I decided to start pursuing my career in tech by enrolling in PHSC's Computer Programming and Analysis AS degree. In this program I've learned the basics of OOP, SQL, and Web Development </p>
		            <h4> YouTube </h4>
		            	<p> Yep, you read that right, YouTube! It amazes me how many resources are at your fingertips. School projects are fun and all but there is nothing like experimenting and learning something new from scratch through personal projects! <br>
		            Here are a few YouTube channels that I believe provide outstanding content for learning new skills:</p>
