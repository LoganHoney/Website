        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <h4> "If we are not moving forward, we are moving backwards." </h4>
        <p> This quote is one that has stuck with me throughout my career. It isn't enough to just maintain status quo, we must continuously be working to improve ourselves. Improving our soft and hard skills also benefits those around us. I decided to take my career seriously in Fall 2023. I have always had an interest in Tech and decided to pursue a career in that field. I realized I needed to learn skills to bring to the table. </p>
